Creating a Platform for Individuals to Track their Carbon Footprint 

## Using Bootstrap to create UI
• used columns and grids to organize elements
• uploading and organizing images
• figured out how to use components (e.g. select, buttons, nav bars, cards and containers)

I also worked on creating separate views and urls for these pages and connecting them to the rest of the project
-> 127.0.0.1:8000/carbon/t1 is where users input their means of transportation. 
There are six options: car, subway, bus, e-scooter, bicycle, and motorcycle.
